    "text": "I'm a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of experience building interactive, scalable, and data-driven web applications. I've developed enterprise tools for Walmart, including a Supply Chain Management System and a Deduction Management Tool. I'm proficient in React.js, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Redux, and modern UI libraries like Material UI and Kendo UI. I specialize in integrating RESTful APIs, optimizing performance with techniques like lazy loading and code splitting, and implementing secure authentication using Auth0. On the backend, I have experience with C#, .NET Core, and SQL, and I focus on writing clean, maintainable code. I'm also experienced with unit testing to ensure code quality and reliability. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating in Agile teams, and building solutions that deliver real business value."
