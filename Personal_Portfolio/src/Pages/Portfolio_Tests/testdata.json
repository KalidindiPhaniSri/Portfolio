On the backend, I have experience with C#, .NET Core, and SQL, and I focus on writing clean, maintainable code. I'm also experienced with unit testing to ensure code quality and reliability. I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating in Agile teams, and building solutions that deliver real business value.",
